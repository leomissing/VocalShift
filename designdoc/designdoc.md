### 2.3. Stages of solving the problem

#### 2.3.1 Metrics Selection
Offline metrics are measures that evaluate the quality of vocal track generation based on historical data and expert assessments.

- **MOS (Mean Opinion Score):** The average quality rating of vocal track generation on a five-point scale, obtained from experts or users.

- **WER (Word Error Rate):** The percentage of errors in recognizing words in the generated track compared to the original song lyrics.

- **F0 RMSE (Fundamental Frequency Root Mean Square Error):** The root mean square error in determining the fundamental frequency of sound in the generated track compared to the original.

- **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) Distance:** The distance between the spectral characteristics of sound in the generated and target tracks.

Online metrics are measures that can be obtained while the system is in operation.

- **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score):** The percentage of users who rated their experience with the chatbot as positive.

- **NPS (Net Promoter Score):** The percentage of users willing to recommend the chatbot to their friends or acquaintances.

- **Retention Rate:** The percentage of users who return to using the chatbot after their initial interaction.

- **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of users who switch to the paid version of the chatbot after using the free version.

Technical metrics are related to the system's performance and speed.

- **Latency:** The time the system takes to process a user's request and generate a response.

- **Throughput:** The number of requests the system can process per unit of time.

- **Availability:** The percentage of time when the system is available and functioning correctly.

- **Error Rate:** The percentage of requests that the system couldn't process or processed incorrectly.

The selection of these metrics allows us to assess the system's effectiveness from various angles, including generation quality, user satisfaction, and system performance. This will enable us to make more informed decisions and enhance the chatbot in line with project requirements and business objectives.

#### 2.3.2. Object and target
Object is a song with the original vocal track.

Target variable is a song with a vocal track replaced by different artist

#### 2.3.3. Data
The data are blocks linking audio tracks annotated with song lyrics and emotion metadata.

#### 2.3.4. Data preparation
Data preparation consists of uploading the trained models to the server and connecting them to the bot itself. Also converting input audio files to WAV format and back to mp3 format output data. Splitting the input audio track into instrumental and vocal parts.

## 3. Pilot Preparation

### 3.1. Pilot Evaluation Method

To evaluate the success of the pilot project of our chatbot the following method is proposed:

In the existing system, we will add a chatbot capable of changing the vocal track in a song to match a different artist's performance. This chatbot will be accessible to users through various chat platforms.

To assess the bot's effectiveness, we will utilize AB testing. One group of users will have access to the chatbot with the new functionality (Group A), while the other group will use the regular chatbot without this feature (Group B).

To evaluate effectiveness, we will collect the following data:

- The number of users using the new functionality.
- The number of sessions in which the new feature was used.
- User satisfaction expressed through surveys and feedback.
- The quality of audio tracks created using the new functionality (evaluated by the audience).
- The time users spend on the platform with the new functionality.

To analyze effectiveness, we will compare the metrics of Group A with those of Group B. It's important to note that we might not have a good online metric so we will rely on proxy metrics such as user satisfaction and audio track quality.

### 3.2. What We Consider a Successful Pilot

We will consider the pilot successful if the following criteria are met:

- An increase in the number of users using the new functionality by at least X% compared to Group B.
- An increase in the average time users spend on the platform with the new functionality.
- User satisfaction (measured by surveys and feedback) should not worsen and may even improve.
- The quality of audio tracks created using the new functionality should be assessed as not inferior to the quality of audio tracks created using the old functionality.
- There should be no significant technical failures or security issues.

If all these criteria are met, the pilot will be considered successful, and we can proceed with the implementation of the new chatbot functionality. Otherwise, we will need to analyze the results, identify issues, and make improvements to the system.

In addition to these success criteria, we will also take into account the return on investment. We will assess how long it will take for the system to become profitable and what the expected income will be from attracting new users using the new functionality.

### 3.3. Pilot Preparation

Preparing the pilot for the VocalShift project involves the following steps:

- **Computational Complexity Assessment:** We will analyze the expected computational load that the chatbot will generate when processing and altering vocal tracks in songs. We will determine the resources (processor, memory, storage) required to ensure smooth and fast bot operation.

- **Baseline Experiment:** Before launching the pilot, we will conduct experiments with the baseline version of the chatbot, which does not include the new functionality for changing vocal tracks. We will assess the performance and computational resources needed for handling regular user requests.

- **Setting Computational Complexity Limits for Models:** If we find that the new functionality significantly increases the computational load, we will set limits on the use of this feature. For instance, we may restrict access to it only for premium subscribers or limit the number of simultaneous requests.

- **Scalability Assessment:** If we discover that the chatbot with the new functionality could face increased popularity and load, we will explore scalability options. This may include the use of cloud resources or optimizing the system architecture.

- **Technical Support Evaluation:** We will prepare the necessary technical infrastructure to support the chatbot in the pilot version. This includes performance monitoring, data backups, and addressing any issues that may arise during the pilot.

- **Estimated Costs Calculation:** We will estimate the budget for preparing and conducting the pilot, including expenses for computational resources, development, testing, and monitoring. These costs will be part of the project's success evaluation.

- **Monitoring Plan Development:** We will establish a monitoring system that tracks the chat bot's performance in real-time. This will enable us to promptly address any issues and improve the bot's operation.

This section of pilot preparation will help ensure the smooth integration of new functionality into the chat bot and minimize risks associated with computational and technical aspects of the project.

### 3.4. Sytem scaling

The scaling of the system depends on the number of users of the bot itself. So this number can vary from one user to 10000, depending on the social success of the bot, but we believe that more than one machine will not be needed to launch the prototype and its success in the first quarter. 

### 3.5 System expansion potential

This system can be extended by using large clusters of servers to be managed by schedulers and orchestrators such as airflow, for example. You should also consider loading and shipping speeds, and separate dials in operations so that you don't create collisions in the machine orchestrators.

## 4. Realization

### 4.1 Service Development
Docker Compouser will be used to orchestrate the project's services, and a standard Python application for working with a Telegram bot will be used to work with Telegram.   
The orchestrator of the model's work will be a Python application built using the Celery distributed computing library.   
Redis will be used in the database for speed of deployment, with the possibility of moving to Postgres in the future.
